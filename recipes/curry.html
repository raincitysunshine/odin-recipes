    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of my main comfort foods is Thai style coconut curry, but it's almost impossible to find a good one at a
        restaurant. That's why I started pounding my own curry paste at home. And I mean pound it--I use a mortar and
        pestle.</p>
    <p>It's a lot of work, but it's worth it. The flavors are so much more vibrant and fresh when you make it yourself.
        And you can adjust the heat and the flavors to your liking.</p>
    <p>Here's my recipe for a Thai-style coconut curry that's not fucking around. This recipe assumes you have already
        made your paste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can of coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of stock or water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of curry paste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of fish sauce</li>
        <li>fresh ginger</li>
        <li>fresh garlic</li>
        <li>fresh shallots</li>
        <li>fresh lemongrass</li>
        <li>fresh hot chilis</li>
        <li>tofu</li>
        <li>as many vegetables as will fit in the pot--I aim for colour variation, including vegetables that are yellow,
            orange, green, and possibly purple</li>
        <li>Thai basil</li>
        <li>fresh scallion</li>
        <li>Jasmine rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>cook the rice</li>
        <li>I know it seems redundant to chop all those aromatics and THEN add the paste but I like big flavours</li>
        <li>Heat a large pot over medium heat and add a little oil</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, shallots, lemongrass, and chilis and cook until fragrant</li>
        <li>Add the curry paste and cook for a few minutes</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk and stock and bring to a simmer</li>
        <li>Add the fish sauce, tofu, and vegetables and simmer for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>At the last minute add the Thai basil</li>
        <li>Top with scallions and serve with rice</li>
