    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for a delicious and versitile cauliflower steak.</p>
    <p>I rarely purchase cauliflower, not because I'm not fond of it. It hasn't been in the reperitoire, for one. But mainly I gravitate more towards vibrant green members of the Brassica family like broccoli--or rich leafy greens like lacinta kale or rainbow chard. Feeling a little more adventurous in general as I explore new terrain in life, I thought, &ldquo;</p>
    <em>I am going to make cauliflower steaks, which will inspire me also to make a chickpea puree and a lemony tahini sauce and all sorts of other Mediterranean-inspired goodies, which I haven't done in...So yeah why not give cauliflower a chance?</em></p>
    <p>And so I did. And I loved it. And I'm going to make it again. And I'm going to share it with you.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cauliflower--as dense and heavy a head as possible</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>a good finishing salt like Maldon</li>
     </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 500&deg;F if you can. Or higher, if possible. My oven went up only to 480.</li>
    <li>Trim most of the leaves off the cauliflower and cut the stem just so the cauliflower sits flat on a cutting board. </li>
    <li>Cut the cauliflower into 1-inch thick slices. You will get 2 to 3 steaks from one head of cauliflower.</li>
    <li>Brush the cauliflower with olive oil, lightly. Here is where I went wrong on my first try--I used too much olive oil, which created too much moisture in the steaks and made it so that they took so long to brown that the cauli ended up quite soft. Er, in steak parlance you would say they were well done. They were not as firm or as rare as we would have preferred.</li>
    <li>Place these lightly oiled cauliflower steaks on a baking sheet lined with parchment and stick it in the oven.</li>
    <li>Roast for 15 minutes or as long as needed to get the steaks nice and brown. </li>
   </ol>
